# Lichess-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis on the Lichess Dataset retrieved from Kaggle

I am a Chess Enthusiast who is also in my final year of a Computer Science Degree at The University of Auckland, New Zealand

Goals/questions to answer for this project (I may not be able to answer them all!)

- Which openings work best generally for certain players within certain rating ranges?
- Are there any obvious patterns related to why players may lose/win games
- Does rating impact what kind of openings players play?
- Does your oponents rating impact which opening you play?
- Do players treat playing higher rated players/lower rated players?
- Is there consequences for playing "safer" against higher rated players

- Final Goal will be to construct some technical and personalized tips/advice based on this analysis 

Method:

- Initially I will do an explatory analysis, just getting a feel for the data, this will include: 
	- Analysis of openings used
	- Analysis of results of games in relation to many other attributes
	- Analysis of Player Ratings
	
- More to come!
